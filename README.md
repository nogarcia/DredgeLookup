# Dredge Encyclopedia Lookup

A small mod for [DREDGE](https://www.dredge.game) that lets you hover over fish in your cargo hold and press a key (L) to instantly look it up in your encyclopedia. Useful for quickly judging prices while fishing!

Requires the [Winch modloader](https://github.com/DREDGE-Mods/Winch).
